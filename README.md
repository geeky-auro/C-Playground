# C---Playground
 A Repo for C++ Concepts and Programs.

## Why C++?
As of September 2020, C++ is the fourth most popular programming language globally behind C, Java and Python, and â€“ according to the latest TIOBE index â€“ is also the fastest growing. <br>
In any large system, you typically find C++ in the lower-level and performance-critical parts. Such parts of a system are often not seen by end-users or even by developers of other parts of the system, so I sometimes refer to C++ as an invisible foundation of everything. <br>

## Philosophy from Wikipedia
ðŸ”¸It must be driven by actual problems and its features should be immediately useful in real world programs.<br>
ðŸ”¸Every feature should be implementable (with a reasonably obvious way to do so). <br>
ðŸ”¸Programmers should be free to pick their own programming style, and that style should be fully supported by C++. <br>
ðŸ”¸Allowing a useful feature is more important than preventing every possible misuse of C++. <br>
ðŸ”¸It should provide facilities for organising programs into separate, well-defined parts, and provide facilities for combining separately developed parts. <br>
ðŸ”¸No implicit violations of the type system (but allow explicit violations; that is, those explicitly requested by the programmer). <br>
ðŸ”¸User-created types need to have the same support and performance as built-in types. <br>
ðŸ”¸Unused features should not negatively impact created executables (e.g. in lower performance). <br>
ðŸ”¸There should be no language beneath C++ (except assembly language). <br>
ðŸ”¸C++ should work alongside other existing programming languages, rather than fostering its own separate and incompatible programming environment.<br>
ðŸ”¸If the programmer's intent is unknown, allow the programmer to specify it by providing manual control. <br>
